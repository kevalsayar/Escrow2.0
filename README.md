## Overview

Our project introduces a cutting-edge blockchain-based escrow system designed to facilitate secure and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers. Leveraging the power of smart contracts, our system allows users to create and engage in deals with confidence, ensuring that funds are locked in escrow until predetermined conditions are met.
